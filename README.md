			<h1> Todo list </h1>
			<ul>
				<li>Add Dynamic GUI. By this I mean GUI that is possible to be added anywhere with one, or two lines of code and no hasttle</li>
				<li>Add 2 player support within an offline game (non server)</li>
				<li>Create graphics for the game (paddles, ball etc) </li>
				<li>Draw font so it's possible to write things on screen (most likely draw with a stylesheet and then load from that</li>
				<li>Create multiple "States" e.g. When one player wins, when other loses etc. Possibly create different game modes?</li>
			</ul>

			<h1> Ideas! </h1>
				<ul>
					<li>Different "game modes". Things like First to five, or one life<p id="rob"> - Rob </p></li>
					<li>Increase in difficulty when no one has scored for large periods of time (server side mostly)<p id="rob"> - Rob </p></li>
					<li>Possibly add 4 player support? and if only 3 players then maybe substitute 1 with AI? <p id="rob"> - Rob </p></li>
					<li>I'd like to maybe see if I could make the AI behive like a proper AI? I mean more advanced movements <p id="rob"> - Rob </p></li>
					<li>Creating awesome intro screen. Most likely like an image or something fading in at the start <p id="rob"> - Rob </p></li>

			<h2> <h2 id="rob"> - Rob </h2> Wed. 27th</h2>
				<ul>
					<li> Line 580. Explained how I did the calculation on where the ball should go once hitting the paddle</li>
					<li> Line 371. Attempted adding the cool "speed" effect of the ball appearing to move really quickly, didn't work but will keep trying </li>
					<li> Line 421. Fixed the bug on pressing the X on the top right hand side to close the game. It now closes properly and turns off everythnig before closing </li>
					<li> Sorry I haven't been as active lately. I'm honestly being bombarded with school work and then stuff in mah private life is just going apeshit and I gotta get it all together and it shall all be good then! </li>
